# Social-media-analytics

Summary:
Our Social Media Analytics project aims to provide deep insights into user engagement , content performance and audience behavior.
We performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Social Media Advertising dataset to understand key trends and relationships in the current market trends.


Solution:
 This data-driven approach helps us achieve our business objectives by providing actionable insights into advertising effectiveness. By identifying the best-performing marketing channels, businesses can allocate their budgets more efficiently, leading to higher conversion rates. The correlation analysis ensures that we understand how different factors contribute to overall campaign performance, allowing us to make informed decisions on scaling advertisements.

   
Approach:
 First, we cleaned the data by converting Acquisition_Cost to a numerical format and ensuring Date was properly formatted. We then analyzed that Clicks and Impressions required normalization due to large scale differences, while Conversion Rate and ROI needed standardization to handle varying distributions. Correlation analysis revealed a strong relationship between Clicks and Impressions, while ROI and Conversion Rate had a moderate correlation.
